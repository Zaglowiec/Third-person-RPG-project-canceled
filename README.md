# Third-person-RPG-project-canceled-

Brave Knight
The game made on the Unity 5.x
An attempt to create a simple RPG with a third-person view. You play the title knight who must clean the island of the creatures inhabited on it using the sword as a weapon. 
The project includes scripts with character movement, character statistics such as health and mana, collecting items to add health. Opponents have a simple AI. The monsters walk around the area, and when the player is nearby, they target the player and attack him

I made the models(when it comes to hero and his opponents), which unfortunately didn't work out well. Writing scripts is way easier for me...

The project was interrupted due to errors caused by character animations etc., there were special skills to be added.

The scripts also include a game save and load script, but it has not been implemented in the game itself.
